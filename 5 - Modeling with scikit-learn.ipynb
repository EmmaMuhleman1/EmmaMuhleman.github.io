    "The `scikit-learn` package provides a robust set of machine learning algorithms for Python. Like all of the packages, we have seen so far, scikit-learn is built upon the core Python scientific stack (i.e. NumPy, SciPy, Cython). One of the biggest reasons of why scikit-learn is so popular is that it has a simple, consistent API, making it useful for a wide range of statistical learning applications. The different components of scikit-learn can be combined to make powerful and expressive pipelines for analyzing data.\n",

    "* **dimensionality reduction** algorithms which reduce the number of **features**, or columns, while preserving information about the data\n",

    "\n",
    "* **n_features**: The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each item in a quantitative manner. Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or discrete-valued in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features (almost always) must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional (e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case where `scipy.sparse` matrices and other techniques can be useful, in that they are much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays."

Transform the comment data to tf-idf, perform TruncatedSVD, and fit a RandomForest model. What happens to the ROC-AUC when you change the number of components in the TruncatedSVD to 2? To 20?
